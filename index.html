                        I was the most senior developer on a research project originating with using non-ai tools to recursively scan a photo of astronomical objects and find a 
                        Threshhold of brightness to determine what was an object. This evolved into using a multiple pass system with continued use of recursion with stricter definitions
                        of pixel brightness. I was the lead designer as the most senior developer on the project.

                        I was a teaching assistant for the Computer Science Department at Berea College where I aided students with studying for exams, and designing solutions for projects.

                        I kept friendly, available, and adapted my method according to how someone learns. If using a board if they were more physical and visual, and less so being lectured.

                        It was an attempt to develop a recursive search method to beat contemporary pre-built library and AI tools at the time of May 2023. We used Python and some AI tools to test our algorithm against
                        and the usage of pycharm. My role was a lead designer interacting with our mentor to help brainstorm and organize our thoughts into models on boards, paper, then eventually into 
                        written code. I worked as the bug tester and optimizer of algorithms written in the development phase.

                        The project was revolved around producing a dynamic social network modeling software and enhance it so it can be used for research and testing of models. It had various tools 
                        available to represent, and organize the data to be simulated in agent driven dynamic social networks. We used pycharm and python, and matplotlib. My role was an assistent researcher 
                        developer for the summer. I helped lead the UI/UX part of development to make the tools developed accessible, easy to understand, and organize it in such a way that is usable.
