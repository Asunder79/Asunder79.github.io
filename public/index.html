                <h1>Summary of me!</h1>
                <p>
                I am a 23 year old Software Enthusiest and Design Nerd named Isaac Gray. I like to tinker and always take an engineer design approach to all my projects.
                That being functionality first, then looks second, and bug fixing last. Getting something presentable and working at minimum by a certain deadline is my 
                main goal. I went to Berea College and currently old a Bachelor of the Arts in Computer & Information Science. I crave for the certainty of the code I write. 
                I am not too used to the "blackbox" of my code, I crave the certainty of C type languages where I know how everything behaves.

                        <p>I take an engineer approach to my projects. I always concern myself with functionality and experience, far before I care about "Styles" and "Cosmetic". </p>
                      <p>  I work my hardest to break problems into smaller problems; I use a small whiteboard to doodle my design choices and represent these smaller problems.  </p>
                      <p> I have a strong desire to have a model for how things should work. I try to have a rule,and a norm for everything.  </p>
                       <p> Much to my dismay, I sometimes struggleWith having a model and rule for everything, which is when I get hesitant. </p>
